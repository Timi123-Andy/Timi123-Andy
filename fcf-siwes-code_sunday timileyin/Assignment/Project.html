        <h2>PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE USING MACHINE LEARNING
           </h2>

        <h3>Introduction to students performance using machine learning</h3>
        <p>
            
            Education has long been one of the most crucial drivers of individual and societal growth, as it directly influences career prospects, personal development, and economic advancement. In recent years, there has been a shift toward data-driven approaches to enhance educational outcomes. By understanding factors that impact student performance, educators and policymakers can make informed decisions to improve educational processes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering the capability to analyze vast amounts of educational data and reveal patterns that may not be evident through traditional analysis. Predictive analysis, specifically, allows educators to identify students at risk of poor performance and intervene before issues become more significant.
            
            In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict student performance based on a variety of factors, including attendance, socio-economic status, academic history, study habits, and participation. Through a data-driven approach, this project will highlight key predictors of academic success, paving the way for interventions tailored to studentsâ€™ individual needs.

        <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to learn from data and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming. Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems learn patterns from data, improving their performance over time.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Types of Machine Learning</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each input.</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data.</li>
                <li> Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
                </li>
            </ol>
